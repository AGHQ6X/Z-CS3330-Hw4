## Project Explaination

The project is able to import CSV files from disk (default file being the "vehicleList.csv" file in the project directory) and store the info for it as modifyable objects with add and remove functionality. It is then able to update the CSV file to contain the modified list.

On top of that, the VehicleManager is capable of displaying information, obtaining vehicles by conditionary searches, and calculating some values based off of the vehicle information found in the CSV.

### Project Dependencies:

The only dependencies for this project are the default Java JRE System Library jars.

### Running the Program:

Because the Main function does not do anything useful on it's own, the Eclipse project enclosed may be opened and the Main can be edited to test code (default is testing the getters and printers) and the project can be run as a normal Eclipse project with no modifications. 

The packages may also be imported into another project to be used as a library.
